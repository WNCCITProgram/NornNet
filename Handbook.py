edu/admissions- aid/ﬁnancial-aid/policies  Academic Policies Advising & Registration WNCC strives to help students achieve their academic goals through personal academic advising.
Advisors can assist students in identifying appropriate programs of study and help students draft an academic plan outlining the courses to meet the requirements for graduation.
This academic plan can be modiﬁed each semester based upon course offerings and student progress.
All new ﬁrst-year students will meet with an academic advisor in the Student Success Center who will help plan the students’ ﬁrst semester of classes at WNCC.
Students are assigned an academic advisor per college policy 500.

Each student is then assigned a faculty advisor who has special training and experience in the student’s academic ﬁeld of interest.
Faculty advisors will help students plan their class schedules after the ﬁrst semester and provide their advisees with ongoing information and assistance in meeting educational goals.
The faculty advisors can also be of assistance to students in their efforts to achieve satisfactory academic progress and connect with other support resources on and off campus.
Students can ﬁnd their assigned faculty advisor in their Student Planning portal.
Questions concerning work in a speciﬁc course should be discussed with the course instructor.
The student’s faculty advisor can answer general questions on scheduling and planning the academic program at any time and particularly during registration advising sessions. 
The faculty advisor’s approval is required for all courses a student wants to take each semester.
This approval is requested and granted through the Student Planning tool in the WNCC portal.
Together, academic and faculty advisors serve as the students’ partners during their time at WNCC.
These advisors can also assist students who are considering changing their programs or who need information regarding transfer to other colleges.

To assist in this effort, the following information is being made available to the campus community.
Nebraska State Statute, §29-4002 declares that sex offenders present a high risk to commit repeat offenses and the efforts of law enforcement agencies to protect communities, conduct investigations, and quickly apprehend sex offenders are impaired by the lack of available information about individuals who have pleaded guilty to or have been found guilty of sex offenses, and who live in their jurisdiction.
Because of that, the Legislature determined that state policy should assist efforts of local law enforcement agencies to protect their communities by requiring sex offenders to register with local law enforcement agencies as provided by the Sex Offender Registration Act.
The State of Nebraska maintains a list of registered sex offenders.
This information may be accessed at the Nebraska Sex Offender Registry website at https://sor.
nebraska.
gov/.
At this web site, you will be given the opportunity to search by name, region, or location.
This information is to be used to provide public notice and information about a registrant so a community can develop and construct a plan to prepare themselves and their families.
Sex offenders have “always” been in our communities.
The notiﬁcation process is intended to remove their ability to act secretly.
Sex offender registry information shall not be used to retaliate against the registrants, their families, or their employers in any way.
Vandalism, verbal, or written threats of harm are illegal and may result in arrest and prosecution.
Procedures for Sexual Harassment/Misconduct Complaints All allegations of sexual harassment, which includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation are addressed following the procedures set forth in the College’s “Sexual Harassment Grievance and Investigation Procedure.

Ethical Standards  Ethical rules, standards, and conduct regulations at WNCC are set forth in writing in order to give students general notice of prohibited conduct.
The standards contain a general category of conduct that violates the Code of Conduct, followed by a list of speciﬁc types of conduct.
These rules, standards, and regulations should be read broadly and are not designed to deﬁne prohibited conduct in exhaustive terms.
In other words, the list set forth herein should be read as saying that the types of conduct in the list are examples of conduct that are covered by a general category rather than an exclusive list.
• A student when charged with an allegation of a violation has the right to a notice of the violation and an opportunity to be heard.
For infractions where suspension, dismissal, or expulsion may be imposed, a student will have additional rights as set forth in the subsequent sections.
• All students are subject to the Code of Conduct.
The term “student” includes all persons enrolled at the College, either as an in-person student or an online student, whether full-time or part-time.
The term “student” also includes: o A person who withdraws from enrollment at the College after allegedly violating the Code of Conduct, but before the charge is adjudicated. 
o A person once enrolled as student, not oﬃcially enrolled for a particular term in which an offense is committed, but who has a continuing relationship with the College.     
o A person living in any College residence hall, although not enrolled at the College.
o A person participating as a learner in a program or activity sponsored by the College, even if such program is conducted away from College premises, in any location, including other states and countries.
o Students who are accused of committing a violation of the Code of Conduct while they are enrolled at the College may still be held responsible for the violation even if they later withdraw from the College prior to a resolution of the alleged violation.
• The ethical rules, standards, and conduct regulations at WNCC also apply to recognized student organizations.
A recognized student organization is responsible for a member’s conduct from the time the student is admitted to membership until the earlier of the student’s permanent termination from membership or is awarded a certiﬁcate or degree.
• Students and student organizations are expected to adhere to all established regulations.
WNCC is committed to maintaining a high standard of ethical h.
